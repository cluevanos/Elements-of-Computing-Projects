# Elements-of-Computing-Projects

This is a repo for the completed projects found in the book The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles. Please don't use this to cheat, you won't learn otherwise :). Or do, I'm not the one who will get in trouble with their professor... tsk tsk.

## Project 01: 
Logic gates built from a provided Nand gate. These gates include Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way 

## Project 02:  
More logic gates consisting of a half adder, full adder, 16bit adder, 16bit incrementer, Or16Way gate, and the ALU
